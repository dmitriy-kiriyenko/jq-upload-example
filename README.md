# Test task

Test task:

1. Open repository on github
2. Work on the 2 task
4. Work for two hours each
5. They will need to put this live in heroku after they are done.
6. Must use Bootstrap Sass

(Task feature #1 User sign in / sign out functionality. User should be
able to visit site and create a new account. User should be able to
edit their own profile / account information. Use gravitar for
temporary avatar images. Use devise.)

Task feature #2 As a member, I can upload images to this application,
using  http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/. Angular version
preferred but not required / if not angular use Basic Plus UI. Images
should upload to S3 using carrier wave / paperclip. This should be
similar to how basecamp works.  You cue the files for upload by
dragging and dropping them in, submit would start uploading them.
Extra point / consideration if there's album functionality per member.

The only requirement is tinder what they can get done with 2 hours.
Also, please make they do regular commits. We will be reviewing each
one.
